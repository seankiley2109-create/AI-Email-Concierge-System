Developed during the TU Dresden International Hackathon, this project is an intelligent email triage system that automatically classifies incoming emails by urgency, sentiment, and support category using Google Vertex AI and NLP.

The system features a Streamlit dashboard for real-time monitoring, prioritisation, and draft response review, helping support teams spend less time sorting emails and more time solving problems. The solution was recognised for its practical applicability in logistics and customer support environments.
